# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Description
Analyzed a telecom dataset of 7,043 customers using Python for preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning. Built a logistic regression model achieving 80% accuracy, identifying churn drivers like contract type and monthly charges for retention strategies.

Skills: Python, Data Preprocessing, EDA, Machine Learning, Analytical Thinking.

Installation
Prerequisites: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook (optional).
Dataset: Download Telco Customer Churn from Kaggle.
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn (pre-installed in Colab).
Usage
Preprocessing: Run Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb in Colab to clean data and engineer features (e.g., tenure groups).
EDA/Modeling: Visualize distributions, train logistic regression, evaluate accuracy.
Analysis: Review feature importance for insights.
Dataset
Source: Kaggle (Telco Customer Churn).
Size: 7,043 customers, 21 columns.
Features: Demographics, services, billing, churn target.
Methodology
Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categoricals, create tenure groups.
EDA: Visualize correlations and churn rates.
Modeling: Train/test split, logistic regression, feature importance.
Results
Accuracy: 80%.
Key Drivers: Contract type, monthly charges, tenure groups.
Visuals: Churn distribution, correlation heatmap, boxplots.
Conclusion
Supports retention by targeting high-risk customers. Preprocessing and EDA enabled accurate predictions.
